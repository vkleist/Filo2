# Filo2

An extension of "Filo". Contains Matlab codes for parameter inference and simulation of both a data-driven, and a mechanistic Markov model of filopodial dynamics and synapse formation in Drosophila R7 photorecptors, used in the Nature Communications paper (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/762179v1).

A detailed description of what the different routines are actually doing can be found in Description.docx
